<h1>Welcome to the Osu! Uniqueness Point (UP) Algorithm Project</h1>

<p>
This project introduces a new ranking system called <strong>Uniqueness Points (UP)</strong>, a product of the 
traditional osu! performance points (pp) and a <strong>multiplier</strong> based on the appearance count of maps amongst top players and
the distribution of the scores set on the map
</p>

<h2>How It Works:</h2>
<ul>
<ol>
    <li class="main-step">From the top 500 players' top 100 best performance, collect the following data:</li>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
        <strong>Appearance Count</strong> â€” every map's appearance count amongst the 50,000 submitted scores<br>
            <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left: 20px;">
            i.e. <em>Songs Compilation VI [Collab Extra]</em> has an appearance count of <strong>18</strong> because
            18&nbsp;/&nbsp;500 players have this map in their top&nbsp;100.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
        <strong>Placement Data</strong> - a set of numbers recording where the map places in player top plays<br>
            <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left: 20px;">
            i.e. <em>Songs Compilation VI [Collab Extra]</em> holds position <strong>1, 9, 3, 1, 1, 
            1, 21, 38, 76, 37, 32, 42, 73, 62, 94, 24, 23, 28</strong> for 18 players
            </span> 
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
        <strong>Total Weighted PP</strong> - for each map, the sum of weighted pp taken from the 50,000 submitted scores<br>
            <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left: 20px;">
            i.e. By adding the weighted pp of the 18 scores on <em>Songs Compilation VI [Collab Extra]</em>, we get <strong>10902.1084</strong>
            </span> 
        </p>

    <li class="main-step">From the data above:</li>
    <p style="line-height: 1.4;"></p>
        <p style="line-height:1.4; margin:0;">
        (1) Plot the Weighted PP graph, sorted from high to low
            <details id="ppPlotDetails" style="display:inline; margin-left:20px;">
                <summary id="ppPlotSummary" style="display:inline; cursor:pointer; color:#ff66aa;">
                [Show Plot]
                </summary>
                <div id="ppPlot" style="width:100%; height:460px; margin-top:8px;"></div>
            </details>
        </p>

        <p style="line-height:1.4; margin:0;">
        (2) Plot the Appearance Count graph, sorted in the same order as the Weighted PP graph
            <details id="acPlotDetails" style="display:inline; margin-left:20px;">
                <summary id="acPlotSummary" style="display:inline; cursor:pointer; color:#ff66aa;">
                [Show Plot]
                </summary>
                <div id="acPlot" style="width:100%; height:460px; margin-top:8px;"></div>
            </details>
        </p>

        <p style="line-height:1.4; margin:0;">
        (3) Fit a curve (reciprocal) to Weighted PP graph, scale it to the Appearance Count graph, and find the highest point of curvature (elbow)
        <details id="fitPlotDetails" style="display:inline; margin-left:20px;">
            <summary id="fitPlotSummary" style="display:inline; cursor:pointer; color:#ff66aa;">[Show Plot]</summary>
            <div id="fitPlot" style="width:100%; height:480px; margin-top:8px;"></div>
        </details>
        </p>

        <p style="line-height:1.4;">
        (4) Compute the <strong>skewness</strong> of the Placement data (if above the elbow)
                <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left: 20px;">
                i.e. From the Placement Data of <em>Songs Compilation VI [Collab Extra]</em>, we get the skewness of 0.671
                </span> 
        </p>

    <li class="main-step">Taking the y-coordinate of the elbow point (currently <strong>18</strong>), apply a different formula to maps above and below this value:</li>

    <ul style="margin-top:6px; font-size:15x;">
    <li>
        <strong>Below the elbow</strong> ($\text{AppearanceCount} < 18$):
        <br>
        $$ \text{UniquenessPoint} = \text{BasePP} \times 1.2^{-(\text{AppearanceCount} + 11.62925)} + 1.05 $$
    </li>

    <li style="margin-top:12px;">
        <strong>At or above the elbow</strong> ($\text{AppearanceCount} \geq 18$):
        <br>
        $$ \text{UniquenessPoint} = \text{BasePP} \times 0.93^{\text{Skewness} \times \left( 2^{\frac{\text{AppearanceCount}}{250}} - 0.2 \right)} $$
        where $250 = \text{Total Players}/2$.
    </li>
    </ul>

</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Formula Explanation:</h2>

<p>
    Maps below the elbow point are identified as uncontested/uncontestable, the value of these scores will receive a simple 
    multiplier that scales with the appearance count, lowest appearance receives the maximum buff of 1.15x, while maps that are closest
    to the elbow point (17) receives the minimum buff of 1.05x. Increasing appearance count drastically lowers this factor.
</p>
<p>
    The formula encourages unique scores to be challenged so its multiplier will be brought down
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Maps that are above the elbow point can be properly evaluated by its skewness of placement data. Positive skew maps
    receives a nerf, negative skew maps receive a buff. The popularity index is multiplied to the skewness to give a more accurate
    buff/nerf. High appearance count will make the skewness more effective than low appearance count.
</P>
<P>
    The formula identifies over-abused maps and punishes them, while slightliy buffing maps that are popular yet difficult for most
    players
</p>
<h2>Motives:</h2>

<p>
With the recent change in the ranking criteria, the performance point ranking system has become heavily mapper depended - 
the types of maps that mappers are able to mass-produce heavily influences the viability of the skillsets to rank up
</p>

<p>
The Uniqueness Point reduces the influence of maps that are tailored to farming performance points, since maps that have high 
skewness (many placement data are high) will be punished, while maps with negative
skewness (many placement data are low) will be buffed. If the maps can't be evaluated properly by its skewness, 
it is rather uncontested and will receive a decaying buff depending on the appearance count
